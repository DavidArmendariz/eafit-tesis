(a)	Terminate	this	Lease,	in	which	event	the	Tenant	shall	immediately	surrender	the	Premises	to	the	Landlord,	but	if	the	Tenant	shall fail	 to	 do	 so,	 the	 Landlord	 may,	 without	 further	 notice	 and	 without	 prejudice	 to	 any	 other	 remedy	 the	 Land	 lord	 may	 have	 for possession	or	arrearages	in	rental,	enter	upon	the	Premises	and	expel	or	remove	the	Tenant	and	its	personal	property	without	being liable	to	prosecution	of	any	claim	for	damages	therefor	and	without	said	entry	affecting	the	Landlord’s	right	to	thereafter	claim	and collect	 all	 monies	 owed	 and	 to	 be	 owed	 under	 this	 Lease.	 The	 Tenant	 shall	 indemnify	 the	 Landlord	 for	 all	 loss	 and	 damage	 that Landlord	may	suffer	by	reason	of	such	termination,	whether	through	inability	to	sublet	the	Premises,	or	through	decrease	in	rental, or	otherwise;

7.4	Surrender	of	Premises.	The	voluntary	or	other	surrender	of	this	Lease	or	the	Premises	by	the	Tenant,	or	a	mutual	cancellation	thereof, shall	not	automatically	work	a	merger	of	the	Landlord’s	and	Tenant’s	estates.	At	the	option	of	the	Landlord,	such	surrender	shall	terminate	all	or any	 existing	 subleases	 or	 subtenancies,	 or	 may,	 at	 the	 option	 of	 the	 Landlord,	 operate	 as	 an	 assignment	 to	 it	 of	 any	 or	 all	 such	 subleases	 or subtenancies.

The	Landlord	and the	Tenant	agree	that	such	payment	shall	not	constitute	a	penalty	or	forfeiture	but	is	payment	of	liquidated	damages.	The	acceptance of	 such	 payment	 by	 the	 Landlord	 shall	 not	 constitute	 a	 waiver	 of	 any	 failure	 of	 the	 Tenant	 to	 comply	 with	 any	 term,	 provision,	 or covenant	of	this	Lease	or	any	violation	of	the	Rules	and	Regulations;

(c)	Enter	the	Premises	as	the	agent	of	the	Tenant	without	being	liable	to	prosecution	or	any	claim	for	damages	therefor,	and	relet	the Premises	as	the	agent	of	the	Tenant,	and	receive	the	rental	therefor,	and	Tenant	shall	pay	to	the	Landlord,	on	demand,	at	the	office of	the	Landlord	any	deficiency	that	may	arise	in	the	event	of	such	reletting;
