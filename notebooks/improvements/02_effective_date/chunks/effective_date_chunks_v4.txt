4. Lease	period.

The	lease	commences	12	August	2021	and	expires	without	termination	on	11	August	2031.	If	the	premises	are	ready	for takeover	at	an	earlier	time,	the	lease	shall	commence	when	the	takeover	protocol	has	been	signed	by	the	Tenant.

In	addition,	the	Tenant	is	entitled	to	extend	the	lease	with	an	additional	two	periods	of	5	years	on	the	same	terms.

The	lease	period	will	automatically	be	extended	with	an	additional	lease	period	if	the	Tenant	does	not	provide	written notification	about	termination	no	later	than	6	months	prior	to	the	expiry	of	the	current	lease	period.

From	the	date	of	entering	into	the	agreement	and	up	until	31	December	2021,	the	Tenant	has	the	right	to	terminate	the agreement	with	3	months'	written	notice,	subject	to	the	payment	of	six	months'	rent	from	the	expiry	of	the	termination	period. The	rental	object	shall	be	handed	over	to	the	Lessor	no	later	than	by	the	end	of	the	termination	period.	The	Tenant	shall	also cover	the	Lessor's	costs	related	to	adaptation	of	the	rental	object	as	described	in	the	Preparatory	Work	Agreement.	The Tenant's	obligation	to	return	the	rental	object	to	the	state	it	was	in	at	takeover,	cf	clause	10,	applies	correspondingly.

5. Value	Added	Tax.

5.a. As	per	signing	the	agreement,	the	parties	have	assumed	that	the	entire	rental	object	shall	be	covered	by	the	Lessor's

voluntary	registration	in	the	Value	Added	Tax	Register.	The	Tenant	ensures	that	the	use	of	the	premises	meets	the conditions	for	registration	from	the	date	of	contract	signing	and	for	the	entire	lease	period.
