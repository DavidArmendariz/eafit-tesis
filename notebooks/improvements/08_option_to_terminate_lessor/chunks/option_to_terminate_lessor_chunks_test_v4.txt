If	Tenant,	by	any	act	or	omission,	or	by	the	act	or	omission	of	any	of	Tenant’s	family	or	invitees,	licensees,	and/or	guests,	violates	any	of	the	terms	or conditions	of	this	Lease	or	any	other	documents	made	a	part	hereof	by	reference	or	attachment,	Tenant	shall	be	considered	in	breach	of	this	Lease (breach	by	one	tenant	shall	be	considered	breach	by	all	tenants	where	Tenant	is	more	than	one	person).

In	case	of	such	breach	Landlord	may	deliver	a	written	notice	to	the	Tenant	in	breach	specifying	the	acts	and	omissions	constituting	the	breach	and that	the	Lease	Agreement	will	terminate	upon	a	date	not	less	than	thirty	(30)	days	after	receipt	of	the	notice	if	the	breach	is	not	remedied	within	a reasonable	time	not	in	excess	of	thirty	(30)	days;	and	the	Lease	Agreement	shall	terminate	and	the	Tenant	shall	surrender	possession	as	provided	in the	notice	subject	to	the	following:
