ASBESTOS	DISCLOSURE Disclosed	Pursuant	to	California	Safety

Asbestos	is	a	common	building	material	that	may	be	present	in	many	buildings	constructed	prior	to	1981.	The	United	States	Environmental	Protection	Agency (EPA)	has	determined	the	mere	presence	of	asbestos	materials	does	not	post	a	health	risk	to	residents	and	that	such	materials	are	safe	as	long	as	they	are	not	disturbed	or dislodged	in	a	manner	that	causes	the	asbestos	fibers	to	be	released.	Sanding,	scraping,	pounding	and	other	remodeling	techniques	that	release	dust	may	cause	asbestos particles	to	become	airborne.

EPA	 rules	 do	 not	 require	 the	 material	 to	 be	 removed.	 Federal	 law	 requires	 that	 reasonable	 precautions	 are	 taken	 to	 minimize	 the	 chance	 of	 damage	 or disturbance	of	asbestos	containing	materials.	Tenant(s)	acknowledge	that	this	is	a	WARNING	that	the	Leased	Premises	may	contain	asbestos	and	may	expose	him/her to	a	chemical	known	to	cause	cancer.
